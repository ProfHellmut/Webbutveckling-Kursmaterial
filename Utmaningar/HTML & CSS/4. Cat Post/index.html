Hack up furballs scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food, yet cat not kitten around but sleep on keyboard. All of a sudden cat goes crazy cat not kitten around, so eat half my food and ask for more meow all night, yet plop down in the middle where everybody walks white cat sleeps on a black shirt.
